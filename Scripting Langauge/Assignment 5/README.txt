Notes:
- I used the provided description file to run my generator script.
- The result is not the same as the example provided due to the different arrangment of states.
- The hardest part is the formating the generated .cpp file. 
- It was also difficult to compare/debug my solution with the example because the formating was all over the place.

How to run:
    - Make sure the description file import fsm.py #import fsm
    - run description file #HOS.py
