Details:
- To run the program please enter 'python3 asgn3.py testFileBase.txt testFile.txt'
- The baseline file is arg 1 and test file is arg 2
- The log file provided was really big it that I gave up running it. Instead, i cut about 25,000 line and run it that way.
- Then I made my own test file instead. 

This assignment was really long but it was fun. I was able to practice the python I learned in class. Using tricks
like enumerate for auto counter and set - union,intersect,etc for finding the cookies in both and either. 
Unfortnately, I was caught up with other classes homework and work that I wasn't able to complete in time. Please forgive me.
