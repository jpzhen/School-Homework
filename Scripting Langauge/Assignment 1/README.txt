Notes:
- asgm1.sh is my script. TestData is my sample data. Music is the data that was provided. TestDataOutput and MusicOutput are the output of using asgm1.sh 
- My sample data will have the script within the tarball. It is the exact same script, I placed it there for it to be a reference 
  where the script need to be.
- The Script might not able to excute. In that case, please chmod u+x asgm1.sh
- All my solutions utilize the command 'find .', which mean the script I wrote must
  be inside of the Music directory along with the genre directories.
- Another thing to look out for is that the directory structure for the script to
  run properly must be the same as the Music.tar (Music/Genre/Artist/Album/Disc(optional)/Songs).
- Please run the script while your current directory is Music/ same with TestData(my sample data I created).
